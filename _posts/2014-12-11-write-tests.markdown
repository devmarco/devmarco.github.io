##Write tests for your project, Please!

If you really want to be a good front-end developer, write tests for your code, just so you can be sure that the code actually works!

There are several types of tests, *unit tests*, *acceptance tests*, *tests of the level of UI*, *integration testing*, etc. You don't need to do all, at a minimum you should test the main features of your system.

There are several frameworks for tests

* [Jasmine - Behavior-Driven JavaScript](http://jasmine.github.io/)
* [Mocha - A feature-rich JavaScript test framework](http://mochajs.org/)
* [QUnit - A powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework](http://qunitjs.com/)

Choose one and be happy!
